### Notes and Credits

Experimental multi-level puzzle game.

All other graphics (including the levels)
were drawn using Scratch's costume editor (in vector mode).

- Level "Julie's" is based on a design by
  [julieheldlaw](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/julieheldlaw/).

I found inspiration for the basic game concept in:

- designing levels for
  [Switches](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/33587070/),
  a puzzle game by
  [archimedes496](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/archimedes496/)
- playing various platform games on Scratch
- watching a TV commercial for
  [Splatoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splatoon)
- memories of playing
  [Marble Madness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble_Madness)
- my obsession to get maximum value out of a minimum of code
- walking the dog at night
